## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 
- CSS

### What I learned

Something I learnt more about while doing this project is the CSS box model. I didn't know much about how it worked before so at first doing this challenge was..well...challenging till I realised 
the knowledge that I was lacking and researched upon it and then the project became easier to complete.
With this CSS code of setting every element to a box sizing of border-box, everything was easier to implement:

```css
*,
*::before,
*::after {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

### Useful resources

- Learn the CSS Box model by Slaying the Dragon(https://youtu.be/nSst4-WbEZK?si=sF6XRMV4JBiwlLxQ) - This youtube video finally made everything click when it came to the Box Model. I'd recommend it to anyone learning this concept.
